# Feature Specification: Daily Challenge Showcase Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-daily-showcase-page`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "毎日　dayX/index.htmlに形にするとして、公開できるようなページを持ちたい。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View All Challenges (Priority: P1)

A visitor wants to see all completed daily challenges in one place to explore the creator's work and progress over time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature - providing a centralized view of all challenges. Without this, visitors have no way to discover the collection of daily works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the showcase page and verifying that all existing day folders are listed with basic information. Delivers immediate value by making the collection discoverable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the showcase page is opened, **When** a visitor views the page, **Then** they see a list of all completed daily challenges in chronological order
2. **Given** multiple challenges exist (day1, day2, etc.), **When** the page loads, **Then** each challenge is displayed with its day number and theme/title
3. **Given** a visitor wants to view a specific challenge, **When** they click on a challenge entry, **Then** they are navigated to that day's index.html page

### User Story 2 - View Challenge Content Directly (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to see the actual content of each challenge directly on the showcase page, allowing them to experience multiple challenges without navigating between separate pages.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by making all work immediately visible and explorable in one place, eliminating the need to click through to each individual page for basic browsing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that each challenge's actual index.html content is displayed within the showcase page. Delivers value by creating a seamless, gallery-like browsing experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple challenges exist, **When** viewing the showcase page, **Then** each challenge's complete visual output is displayed
2. **Given** a challenge contains interactive elements, **When** viewing it on the showcase page, **Then** those interactive elements function correctly within the showcase context
3. **Given** challenges have different visual designs, **When** viewing the showcase, **Then** each challenge's unique styling is preserved and displayed correctly

### User Story 3 - Access Latest Work (Priority: P3)

A returning visitor wants to quickly see the most recent challenge without scrolling through the entire list.

**Why this priority**: Improves usability for repeat visitors but is not essential for initial MVP. The feature is still functional without this optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the most recent challenge is visually highlighted or positioned prominently. Delivers value by reducing friction for repeat visitors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple challenges exist, **When** the showcase page loads, **Then** the most recent challenge is visually distinct or positioned at the top
2. **Given** a new challenge is added, **When** the page is refreshed, **Then** the new challenge becomes the featured/latest entry

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no challenges exist yet (empty state)?
- What happens when a day folder exists but index.html is missing or inaccessible?
- How does the page display on mobile devices with limited screen width?
- How does the showcase handle challenges with different dimensions or aspect ratios?
- What happens when a challenge loads external resources (fonts, scripts, APIs) that may fail or be slow?
- How does the system handle challenges that use conflicting global styles or scripts?
- What happens when day numbers are non-sequential (e.g., day1, day2, day5)?
- How does the showcase handle very large numbers of challenges (e.g., 100+ days)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of all daily challenge folders (day1, day2, day3, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST present challenges in a clear, scannable format with visual hierarchy
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide access to view each challenge's complete page (dayX/index.html)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display each challenge by showing its actual index.html content directly
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle the absence of challenges gracefully with an appropriate empty state message
- **FR-006**: System MUST be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-007**: System MUST present challenges in reverse chronological order (newest first, descending by day number)
- **FR-008**: System MUST function as a static site that can be hosted on static hosting platforms
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically discover new day folders without requiring manual configuration or updates to the showcase page
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to add new challenges by simply creating a new dayX/index.html file without additional steps

### Key Entities

- **Daily Challenge**: Represents a single day's coding challenge output, including day number, theme/title, optional description, and link to the full page (dayX/index.html)
- **Showcase Page**: The central index/landing page that aggregates and displays all daily challenges in a cohesive, publicly presentable format

### Assumptions

- Daily challenges follow a consistent folder naming convention (day1, day2, day3, etc.)
- Each day folder contains an index.html file as the entry point
- The showcase will be deployed as a static site compatible with static hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- No build process or server-side logic is required - the solution must work with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- New challenges are added by creating a new dayX folder with index.html inside it
- Day numbers are sequential and start from 1

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Visitors can view all available challenges in a single page load without pagination
- **SC-002**: Visitors can navigate to any specific challenge in 2 clicks or fewer (view showcase → click challenge)
- **SC-003**: The page loads and displays all challenge information in under 2 seconds on standard connections
- **SC-004**: 100% of existing challenge folders (day1, day2, etc.) are automatically discovered and displayed without manual configuration
- **SC-005**: The showcase page is visually cohesive and presentable for public sharing (appears intentionally designed, not like a raw file listing)
